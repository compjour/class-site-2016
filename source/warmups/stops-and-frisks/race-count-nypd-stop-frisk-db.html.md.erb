## Simple

~~~py
from csv import DictReader
with open('2015-nypd.csv', 'r') as f:
    datarows = list(DictReader(f))

race_counter = {}
for d in datarows:
    r = d['race']
    if race_counter.get(r):
        race_counter[r] += 1
    else:
        race_counter[r] = 1

for key, val in race_counter.items():
    pct = round(100 * val / len(datarows))
    print("For race:", key, 'number:', val, ' percentage:', pct)

## Using Counter

~~~py
from csv import DictReader
from collections import Counter
with open('2015-nypd.csv', 'r') as f:
    datarows = list(DictReader(f))

race_counter = Counter()
for d in datarows:
    race_counter.update(d['race'])

for key, val in race_counter.most_common():
    pct = round(100 * val / len(datarows))
    print("For race:", key, 'number:', val, ' percentage:', pct)
