# Solutions

Note: the following solutions assume that there's a local file named `2015-nypd.csv`. You can set it up like this:

~~~py
import requests
url = 'http://stash.compjour.org/samples/stops-and-frisks/2013-nypd.csv'
resp = requests.get(url)
with open('2013-nypd.csv', 'w') as thefile:
    thefile.write(resp.text)
~~~


## Simple

~~~py
from csv import DictReader
with open('2015-nypd.csv', 'r') as f:
    datarows = list(DictReader(f))

race_tally = {}
for d in datarows:
    r = d['race']
    if race_tally.get(r):
        race_tally[r] += 1
    else:
        race_tally[r] = 1

for key, val in race_tally.items():
    pct = round(100 * val / len(datarows))
    print("For race:", key, 'number:', val, ' percentage:', pct)
~~~




## Using Counter

~~~py
from csv import DictReader
from collections import Counter
with open('2015-nypd.csv', 'r') as f:
    datarows = list(DictReader(f))

race_tally = Counter()
for d in datarows:
    race_tally.update(d['race'])

for key, val in race_tally.most_common():
    pct = round(100 * val / len(datarows))
    print("For race:", key, 'number:', val, ' percentage:', pct)
~~~


~~~stdout
For race: B number: 11950  percentage: 53
For race: Q number: 5090  percentage: 23
For race: W number: 2514  percentage: 11
For race: P number: 1409  percentage: 6
For race: A number: 1103  percentage: 5
For race: Z number: 298  percentage: 1
For race: U number: 122  percentage: 1
For race: I number: 77  percentage: 0
