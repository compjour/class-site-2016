> The 46th Precinct has about 128,000 residents and includes the predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods of University Heights, Morris Heights and Fordham. Officers used force in __58 percent of stops last year__, the highest rate of any of the city’s 76 precincts, according to The Times’s analysis. 


This assumes you have a file named `'2011.csv'`

~~~py
from csv import DictReader
csv_fname = '2011.csv'
with open(csv_fname, 'r', encoding='latin-1') as rf:
    datarows = list(DictReader(rf))

pct_num = str(46)
precinct_rows = []
for d in datarows:
    if d['pct'].strip() == pct_num:
        precinct_rows.append(d)

force_count = 0
for d in precinct_rows:
    was_force_used = None
    for header, value in d.items():
        if 'pf_' in header:
            if value == 'Y':
                was_force_used = True
    if was_force_used:
        force_count += 1

print("Total stops in precinct:", len(precinct_rows))
print("Stops with force used:", force_count)        
print("Pct force used:", round(100 * force_count / len(precinct_rows) ))

Using glob



~~~py
from csv import DictReader
from glob import glob
from os.path import join
my_filenames = join('mydata', 'fetched', '*', '*.csv')

for csv_fname in glob(my_filenames):
    with open(csv_fname, 'r', encoding='latin-1') as rf:
        print(csv_fname)
        datarows = list(DictReader(rf))

        pct_num = str(46)
        precinct_rows = []
        for d in datarows:
            if d['pct'].strip() == pct_num:
                precinct_rows.append(d)

        force_count = 0
        for d in precinct_rows:
            was_force_used = None
            for header, value in d.items():
                if 'pf_' in header:
                    if value == 'Y':
                        was_force_used = True
            if was_force_used:
                force_count += 1

        print("Total stops in precinct:", len(precinct_rows))
        print("Stops with force used:", force_count)        
        print("Pct force used:", round(100 * force_count / len(precinct_rows)))
