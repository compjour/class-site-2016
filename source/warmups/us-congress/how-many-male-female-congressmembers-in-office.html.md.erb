~~~py
import requests
SOURCE_URL = 'http://stash.compjour.org/samples/us-congress/legislators.csv'
resp = requests.get(SOURCE_URL)

## Super naive

~~~py
from csv import DictReader
with open('legislators.csv', 'r') as f:
    datarows = list(DictReader(f))

m_count = 0
f_count = 0

for d in datarows:
    if d['in_office'] == '1':
        x = d['gender']
        if x == 'M':
            m_count += 1
        elif x == 'F':
            f_count += 1


print("F:", f_count)
print("M:", m_count)
~~~




## Using a dictionary to keep count

~~~py
from csv import DictReader
with open('legislators.csv', 'r') as f:
    datarows = list(DictReader(f))
g_counter = {}
for d in datarows:
    if d['in_office'] == '1':
        x = d['gender']
        if g_counter.get(x):
            g_counter[x] += 1
        else:
            g_counter[x] = 1

for key, val in g_counter.items():
    print("%s: %s" % (key, val))
~~~




## Using collections.defaultdict to keep count

~~~py
from csv import DictReader
from collections import defaultdict
with open('legislators.csv', 'r') as f:
    datarows = list(DictReader(f))

g_counter = defaultdict(int)
for d in datarows:
    if d['in_office'] == '1':
        x = d['gender']
        g_counter[x] += 1

for key, val in g_counter.items():
    print("%s: %s" % (key, val))
~~~



## Using collections.Counter to keep count

~~~py
from csv import DictReader
from collections import Counter
with open('legislators.csv', 'r') as f:
    datarows = list(DictReader(f))
g_counter = Counter()
for d in datarows:
    if d['in_office'] == '1':
        x = d['gender']
        g_counter.update(x)

for key, val in g_counter.items():
    print("%s: %s" % (key, val))
~~~


## More compaction with list comprehension

~~~py
from csv import DictReader
from collections import defaultdict
with open('legislators.csv', 'r') as f:
    datarows = list(DictReader(f))

g_counter = Counter()
in_office_rows = [d for d in datarows if d['in_office'] == '1']
for d in in_office_rows:
    x = d['gender']
    g_counter.update(x)

for key, val in Counter(gender_list).items():
    print("%s: %s" % (key, val))
~~~

## Even more compaction

~~~py
from csv import DictReader
from collections import defaultdict
with open('legislators.csv', 'r') as f:
    datarows = list(DictReader(f))

gender_list = [d['gender'] for d in datarows if d['in_office'] == '1']
for key, val in Counter(gender_list).items():
    print("%s: %s" % (key, val))
