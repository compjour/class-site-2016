##### Homework

Due on __Monday__, via today's lesson plan: 

[Practice examining NYPD Stop and Frisk Data using interactive Python.](/lessons/static/where-is-nypd-stop-and-frisks)



### Week 2 - Text and Visualizing Text

#### April 4 / April 6



We'll continue reviewing the Python programming fundamentals, in the service of deserializing text into data structures, and, when necessary, turning data structures into text files, particularly formatted as CSV and JSON.

- We'll also create our first static charts using [matplotlib](http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/matplotlib.html).
- And we'll create our very first news app, courtesy of [NICAR's First News App tutorial](http://first-news-app.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). 


### Week 3 - Filtering noise / Web scraping

#### April 11 / April 13

Our problem is not lack of information. It's lack of attention span. Data is not much good to us if we can't sort it the way we need it to be sorted. Hence, the need to scrape webpages and PDFs.

We'll use <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/">ProPublica's Dollars for Docs as a case study</a>.

By now, we'll have written a fair amount of HTML. Web-scraping generally involves learning one more kind of text parser, such as lxml or BeautifulSoup, and writing the automated logic to navigate a website.



### Week 4 - APIs

#### April 18 / April 20

[David Yanofsky of Quartz](http://qz.com/author/davidyanofskyquartz/) will talk about his entrepreneurial work in data visualization and investigations.
