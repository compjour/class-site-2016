# Learning from NICAR's First News App

This is a slimmed-down version for [NICAR's First News App](http://first-news-app.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). The overall concept is the same but I'll try to present the bare minimum of configuration.

## What we skip

Here's what I skip from the NICAR First News App tutorial:

- All the `virtualenv` commands, which is used to create a separate environment where additional Python libraries can be installed for a specific project/app that we're working without causing conflicts with the rest of the system...but that's a very, very low priority for us right now.
- git and Github -- we're just playing around on a lone test project. No need to worry about version control.

Basically, if you were following along the NICAR tutorial, you'd skip to the heading titled, [Act 2: Hello Flask](http://first-news-app.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#act-2-hello-flask). But you don't need to follow their tutorial for now; this tutorial is meant to be self-contained, albeit because it's a very simple app.
