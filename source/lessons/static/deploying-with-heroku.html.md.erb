Heroku provides a mostly-push-button service to deploy an app...but you have to be relatively comfortable with the command line. [Here's one official guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python-o). One benefit of Heroku is that it is free.

I've [put up a sample app that I was able to deploy on Heroku](https://github.com/dannguyen/flask-firerain)...Two main differences from the Heroku tutorial are:

- Making your own [requirements.txt](https://github.com/dannguyen/flask-firerain/blob/master/requirements.txt) (a list of third-party libraries that you import)
- [Creating a runtime.txt](https://github.com/dannguyen/flask-firerain/blob/master/runtime.txt) that specifies Python 3.5
