# Installing Anaconda 3

We'll be using Python 3.5 for this class. The easiest way to install it is to use Anaconda, which is a self-contained installer that "just works" (usually).

If you know what you're doing (i.e. you're familiar with the command-line)

Else, download the approrpiate package from here and double-click on the `.pkg`/`.exe` file:

- [Mac OS X 64-bit Python 3.5 Graphical Installer](https://3230d63b5fc54e62148e-c95ac804525aac4b6dba79b00b39d1d3.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Anaconda3-2.5.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg)

- [Windows 64-bit Python 3.5 Graphical Installer](https://3230d63b5fc54e62148e-c95ac804525aac4b6dba79b00b39d1d3.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Anaconda3-2.5.0-Windows-x86_64.exe)
